<h1>Mouse Macros</h1>

<p>
I can be obsess with productivity. Or I am really "lazy". Maybe a little both.
</p>

<p>
Always been a fan of hotkeys. I have used them for frequent websites, intranet apps, and autocomplete forms. I use <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/">Autoit</a> and occasionally <a href="http://ahkscript.org/"AutoHotkey</a>.

One tool that I have really taken to is the gaming mouse. Essentially a mouse with macro keys.
</p>

<p>
I currently use the red dragon gaming mouse [amazon link]. Besides your typical mouse (left/right/scroll keys), it has 12 side mouse keys and one “fire key” or a 2nd left click.

I’ve tried a couple different combos for the keys but I’ll share what I have settled on for a good while.
</p>

<p>
Here is the layout:
1 - 2 - 3
4 - 5 - 6
7 - 8 - 9
10 - 11 -12
</p>

<p>
1-2-3
“Inbox Zero”. 
</p>

<p>
One is Done.
Two is ToDo.
Three is Free (for now).
</p>
<p>
Or Done, Action, & waiting. Whatever works for you.
</p>
<p>
4 - 5 - 6
Ctrl-C/V/X
Copy - Paste - Cut
</p>
<p>
How many times do you copy/paste? And occasionally cut? I do a lot. Links. Code. Passwords. Ctrl-C/V/X are A-OK in my book. The finger gymnastics is not so bad when it is 2 keys near each other...but I use these a lot. Your mileage may vary.
</p>
<p>
7 - 8 - 9
Browser
Close Tab - New Tab - Re-open closed tab
</p>
<p>
Another thing I use a lot is a web browser. Chrome to be precise. Obviously ctrl-w, ctrl-t, and ctrl-shift-t (finger gymnastics). You can really go down some browser rabbit holes without moving your hand from the mouse to the keyboard. Often a copy/paste with a new tab. Throw in some middle/ctrl clicks for opening new tabs...Or a hand chrome extension (link dump). 
</p>
<p>
Keep the right hand on the mouse!
10 - 11 - 12
Backspace - Delete - Close Window
</p>
<p>
So real quick. Number 12. Close window (Alt + F4). How often do you close a window? A lot. Do you finger somersault your left thumb to Alt &amp; your middle finger to F4? Use two hands? What if your hand is on the mouse and you clicked on the application that needs to be closed...then what? Huh? Make your move punk. Ok. carried away there. 
</p>
<p>
So never occurred to me over so many years that once you take your right hand off the keyboard how many pivotal keys you are then missing. Delete &amp; backspace are crucial keys. Often we move to the mouse to move the cursor. Then back to the keyboard to delete. Back to the keyboard...DEL. back to the mouse. Find text to destroy. Click. Back to keyboard delete. Crap hit end. …
</p>
<p>
I’m welcom to being wrong...but delete &amp; backspace are two keys that we use a lot. Moving your forearm/wrist/hand back and forth for every time you need to move the cursor to delete/backspace gets old real quick. 
</p>
<p>
Ah but you say (well my brain things you will say this with a non-descript european accent)...what about enter? It does not exist on the left side of the keyboard and your out of macro keys. What you gonna give up.
</p>
<p>
So i have used the Number Pad Enter with my thumb...But no more. The last key I think is pivitol is the secondary left click key. The fire key. The cremedelacreme of all the keys. Enter. 
</p>
<p>
Copy link to address bar. Paste. Enter. In the words of Shaquelle O’neil...Shazzam!
</p>
<p>
So that’s the gist of how I use the Macro Mouse. There are other macro mice out there. I’ll do a write up of the software that it uses. There are others out there. I like Logitech’s software for their hotkey enabled devices. But their macro mouse is missing my “enter” extra left click.
</p>
<p>
Can’t say I’m complete set in my ways...meaning if someone has a better sugestion, layout tweek feel free to let me know. I’ve tried different things and have been on this for a while. One point switched delete &amp; backspace...But then I realized that backspace doubles as a back key on a browser/explorer (Chrome extension needed).
